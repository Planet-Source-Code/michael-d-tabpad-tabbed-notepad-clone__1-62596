## TabPad \- Tabbed Notepad Clone


</div>

### Description

TabPad is pretty much just a clone of Microsoft's Notepad, but with tabs. I like the way Notepad looks, feels and works, but I like tabs too, so I combined the two. TabPad will work standalone, or you can go into File Types and associate text documents (eg. TXT, INI) with it and it will happily open each document in a tab as opposed to a new instance of the program. TabPad will open as many tabs as you please, and supports standard Notepad functions (such as Find + Replace). Most of the code in TabPad is pretty straight forward, all indented, if you need any help I will reply to comment or you can email me via the email provided in the program. Oh, and the close tab button will slide along the TabStrip fairly seamlessly - it will cover a tab occasionally but it's probably better than using a whole row underneath the strip for one box, like I was just before I changed it. I hope you enjoy TabPad - leave feedback or vote if you like it :)

Screenshot didnt seem to work, you can see it here:
